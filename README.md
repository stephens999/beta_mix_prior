# beta_mix_prior

This repo will apply a more flexible version of the configuration model to the famililar mutiple tissue case, in which we use a mixture of multivariate normals defined by their covariance matrices U_k to model the prior distribution for \beta_{j}. However, we are not restricted to the binary nature of the configuration.
